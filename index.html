My grade 12 high school was completed in 1997 and soon afterwards I moved to Queensland. Our mother tongue at home has always been Australian English.
</p><p>During the early 1990’s unemployment levels were at an all time high, so I was afforded the opportunity to move to Indonesia where I until recently resided.
</p><p>This period was where I was thrown into the deep end of business, learning the local languages, marketing and eventually the birth of technology such as windows and ultimately, the internet.
</p><p>While not manufacturing and exporting garden furniture, I like to spend my time fishing with cold beers or smoking meats with cold beers; so much so that I built my own smoker trailer.</p></div>

Computers and software intrigued me and I could not get enough of experimenting. Since playing Duke Nukem 3D I began my interest in the hardware behind the computing. Installing sound and graphic cards, network cards, modems then setting up LANs then eventually dial up servers for death matches. 
</p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Since those days not much has changed. I still am building my own computer and fixing everyone else’s computer. I have ended up the go-to guy in our city for computer issues both software and hardware. &nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Since 2015 I have been teaching Cambridge IGCSE (Grade 10) ICT. This is very similar to this Introduction to IT course in some ways, but I am teaching the young students about things like fax machines, CRT monitors and ZIP drives. Fortunately, I grew up through this era and don’t need to study to teach this subject. &nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After returning to Australia in march 2019 and compeled my Diploma of Business, I now intend to further my education with a Bachelor of International Business. One of the prerequisites suggested by the advisor was to take this course first. &nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I expect from this course to refine my knowledge and am already finding it very interesting. An example would be GitHub where you are reading this page now. Previously it is not something I would have been too interested in exploring but now I am finding it quite fascinating. Also, the online sessions. Since partaking in these I have explored other platforms such as BigBlueButton and have used that to run a couple of classes from afar and it has had a very good reception&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<br>
<br> 
<br>The salary package for me is only one of the things that make this position appealing to me. Working with data and manipulating data to produce a variety of information has always appealed to me. Building on, revamping or streamlining older systems to make production or administrative tasks more efficient gives me great pleasure. Using data and reports to make predictions, forecasts and planning I have found to be one of the most necessary skill sets that I have.
<br>
<br>This position will require someone who is passionate about IT and keeping their skills up to date with modern technologies. The candidate should have quite a few years’ experience and proven track record working with data in the business sector, and the skills to analyse that data to make informed decisions on planning. <br><br>For this position the applicating needs to be confident working within a team and proactive within that environment. The ability to stay focused on the task and find a solution would be a major component of the position. Most importantly, being able to demonstrate experience as a team leader is essential to be successful is required to be considered for this role. Excellent communication and problem-solving skills while working under stress are paramount. To qualify for this position, one must be an Australian citizen or permanent resident.

However, I did not see Problem Solving mentioned in this summary and I feel that this trait is a strong part of my personality.<br><br>In a team environment, I feel that after reviewing these results that I would need to curtail such traits as being forceful and better focus on traits such as  results and bottom line.<br><br>When forming a team, I should let other team members know that I have strengths in the administration and sticking to goals and targets.

<br>Children always have and continue to play with toys. In this time, toys have evolved from sticks and stones to highly intelligent smart devices such as tablets, robotics, gaming consoles, and drones just to mention a few. In my experiences dealing with children, the children of today can adapt to technology much quicker in these last few years compared to only ten years ago. The technology that is available to them now is much more user-friendly and users are much more comfortable with it.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>I would like to develop a robot similar to the Jimu Robot, or expand on the software for the Jimu Robot so that it would require the use of a different language to perform a task.
</p><p>Ideally, this would be done via voice recognition selected on the app that controls the robot. The parent or teacher could set a task, for example, to have the robot navigate an obstacle course. Once the student could do this effectively in their mother tongue, the parent or teacher could change the settings and have the child redo the exercise in another chosen language.
</p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There are already robots in toy stores that have preprogrammed responses to voice recognition however not as intelligent as Siri or Google. I want to develop one of these “loveable” robots or fluffy robotic toys to be able to interact with children using different languages. This could be a simple as replying to a Good morning gesture or even asking to please repeat the question in another specific language.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Now all this sounds very simple, but this does involve some serious artificial intelligence. A group of experts would need to be assembled to decide on the outlines of the system. Experts such as teachers, linguists, child psychologists, protection agencies, translators, and others would need to develop the knowledge base.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Jimu robot as mentioned above used the Blockly coding system that is developed by Google. This coding system is very functional in the fact that the code can be exported to many of the popular coding languages such as Java Script, Python, PHP and others.  Please see https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/overview for more information. Therefore producing the actual code should not really be a major hurdle in developing this “bilingual robot”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Possible drawbacks would be that a voice recognition engineer would really need to make major changes to the “analog to digital systems”, as children’s voices are widely spread across the sound spectrum and their pronunciation is still developing. As this project involves language, there is also the difficulty of distinguishing accents of children originating from various countries. This is something I often see with my own children when they are using voice recognition to search up a youtube video and the results of their voice searches are often quite dissimilar to what they were trying to say. Another possible drawback is that the microphone would have to be small enough to fit into the robot, and the robot would most likely be in a noisy environment, therefore running a risk of receiving poorer audio quality making it more difficult yet again to digitize.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">By developing an intelligent application to be used on a device by the child would also be beneficial in a number of ways. By using words either written and/or spoken from the app would overcome a lot of the major voice recognition concerns. Also, the child would not only be able to improve their sight words and reading skills, but be able to learn written language that may not be in their current script such as roman numerals, sand scripts such as Tamil, Arabic or Thai and Asian languages such as, Hanzi and Kanji.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ultimately I feel that this technology would truly benefit the young learners of today and eventually make us all close “global citizens”. Its technology that is new, it is fun, it is educational and extremely useful for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>
